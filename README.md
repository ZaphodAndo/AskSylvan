## What is it? ❓

AskSylvan is a question and answer web app that allows you to create quiz's that other people can then attempt to answer.

This project came about when the chief apprentice herder at the company I work for wanted to improve the way he tests the knowledge of those within the company.

## How does it work? 🤔

Users can create quiz's which are made up of a series of questions and answers.

Users can then pick a quiz to go through and attempt to answer each question one at a time.

After answering a question it will show the user the answer to the question so that they can see whether they were correct or not before proceeding onto the next question.

## How do I set it up? 🤷‍♂️
